## [Unreleased]

### Added
- ONNX importer foundation: protobuf parse, per-domain opset validation
  (core >= 17, ai.onnx.ml >= 1), operator allowlist, and typed
  `OnnxImportError` (parameter extraction deferred to #5/#6).
- `model_io::import_json` for the JSON exchange path used by the CLI and demos.
- RISC Zero guest program and host `generate_receipt` with journal
  cross-checks (dev-mode CI; real proving documented and `#[ignore]`d).
- Shared inference engine in `zkml-common` for native and guest paths.
- `commitment_hash` abstraction over model/input binding (Poseidon: #13).
- Minimal golden vectors under `crates/zkml-prover/tests/vectors/`.
- `PartialOrd` / `Ord` for `FixedPoint` (same-scale raw integer comparison).
- `Add`, `Sub`, and `Mul` operators as panicking wrappers over checked arithmetic.
- `Neg` for `FixedPoint` so negation uses the standard unary operator.
- `FixedPoint::abs`, `is_zero`, and `signum` helpers.
- `FixedPoint::clamp` for range saturation.
- `sum` and `mean` slice reductions for pooling layers.
- `max`, `min`, and `argmax` slice reductions for max-pooling and classification.
- ZK-friendly `leaky_relu` activation with a power-of-two slope.
- `relu6` bounded activation for quantized networks.
- `hard_sigmoid` and `hard_swish` piecewise-linear activations.
- `hardtanh` bounded activation clamping to `[-1, 1]`.
- Element-wise `relu6_vec`, `hard_sigmoid_vec`, and `hard_swish_vec` helpers.
- Initial workspace scaffold with `zkml-common`, `zkml-prover`, and
  `zkml-verifier` crates.
